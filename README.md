build.sh is a tool for making, updating and managing Drupal installations from the development phase to production. 

It is built to:
 - Eliminate the need to have 3rd part code in your repository.
 - Make core and module updates fast and easy.
 - Enhance security of your Drupal installation.
 - Make your life just a little bit easier and worry free.

The example configuration file in conf/site.yml defines the following commands:
